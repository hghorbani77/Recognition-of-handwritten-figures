# Recognition of Handwritten Persian Digits using MLP Neural Network
# تشخیص ارقام دست‌ نویس فارسی
## Description
In this project, a dataset of handwritten Persian digits has been identified using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. In this repository, you can find the source code and results related to the training and evaluation of this neural network.

## Features

- Utilization of MLP for the recognition of handwritten Persian digits.
- Plotting the error curve during the training phases.
- Explanation of the maximum achieved accuracy in this project.
- Examination of accuracy in recognizing different digits.

## Installation and Execution

To use the source code, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/handwritten-persian-digits-recognition.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd handwritten-persian-digits-recognition
   ```

3. Run the code and train the neural network:
   ```bash
   python 1_MLP.py
   python 2_Autoencoder.py
   python 3_DeepNetwork.py
   python 4_Augmentation.py
   ```
